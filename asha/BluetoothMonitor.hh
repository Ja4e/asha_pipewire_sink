// Class that monitors for bluetooth advertisement protocols.
// TODO: The kernel implementation appears to be broken. With btmon, I can see
//       bluez registering for an advertisement monitor with handle 0x0001, and
//       then advertisement responses coming back with handle 0, which bluez
//       discards.
// TODO: I think bluez utilizes a microsoft extension for this feature, but it
//       will also use these callbacks if you turn on the add device dialog, so
//       there is obviously some sort of software fallback.
// Alternatives:
//    Randomly attempt to connect to devices.
//    Turn on scanning, monitor the rssi ourselves.
//       My hearing aids report an rssi of -80 most of the time, unless
//       I literally hang them from the antenna.
//    Turn on scanning, rely on AdvertisementMonitor, which kinda-sorta-works
//    when you do that.
//    Use adapter filter on mac addresses or services relevant to us.
//       How does it filter on services if it doesn't do device discovery? it
//       has to rely on service announcements, right?
//       Doing StartDiscovery is not passive. It will contact devices to
//       resolve mac addresses. This might be a good thing if hearing devices
//       use random mac addresses (mine don't)
